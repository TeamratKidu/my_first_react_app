## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v6 or higher)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add your OMDB API key (get one from [OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx)):
     ```env
     REACT_APP_OMDB_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

4. **Run the App**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- The app loads with a default search for "Hellboy".
- Enter a movie title in the search bar and click the search icon to fetch movies.
- A "No Movies Found" message appears if no results are returned.

## Project Structure

- `src/App.jsx`: Main component with search logic and UI.
- `src/MovieCard.jsx`: Component for displaying movie cards.
- `src/App.css`: Styles for the app.
- `src/search.svg`: Search icon for the UI.

## Security Note

- The API key is stored in a `.env` file for development. For production, proxy API requests through a backend to avoid exposing the key.
- Ensure `.env` is in `.gitignore`.
